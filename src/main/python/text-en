The Foreign Ministry said on Friday (15) investigating a complaint of harassment against the Consul General of Brazil in Sydney, Americo Fontenelle. An ambassador was sent to Australia to gather information on the complaint made by outsourced server Lu√≠s Henrique Neves Aroeira, responsible for trade promotion department of the Consulate, which Fontenelle accused of offending him repeatedly.

The complaint was made in a letter to the foreign minister, Antonio Patriota, and the Inspector of the ministry, sources Denis Souza Pinto. Neves, who was hired in Sydney, says Fontenelle has a habit offend and humiliate servers, not just him. Also the deputy ambassador, Cezar City, would have the same attitude. The Magistrate then decided to open an investigation into the two diplomats. As this is an investigative mission, Fontenelle has no attorney in the case. The report could not locate it on Friday due to time zone.

If the information passed on by Neves letter can be confirmed by the so-called "investigative mission," the Foreign Ministry's internal affairs will open an inquiry that can lead even the expulsion of Fontenelle frame server, although this has never happened in the ministry because of allegations of bullying. This is not the first time that Fontenelle is accused of humiliating and offending servers. Before Consul General in Toronto, Canada, the ambassador went through a similar investigation, but that came to nothing beyond his transfer to Australia. The recurrence, however, can worsen your situation. Recently, the Union of servers Foreign Ministry issued notes on its website about other cases of bullying. In September 2012, a chancery official of the Brazilian embassy in Abuja, Nigeria, was moved back to Brazil after a negotiation to end another case of bullying. At the same time, another officer, packed in Belgrade, also filed a complaint of harassment against the ambassador's post. The case went no further.
